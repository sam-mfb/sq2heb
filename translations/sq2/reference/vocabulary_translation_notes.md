## Translation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Verb Strategy:** Include multiple forms (imperative, infinitive, future tense) to match natural player typing habits
2. **Noun Strategy:** Base form only - AGI compiler auto-generates prepositional prefixes (ל, ה, ב, מ)
3. **Style Guide:** 80s Israeli humor/slang, cultural adaptation, preserve original comedic tone
4. **Placeholders:** Always preserve AGI codes (%v0, %w1, %s0, %m8) and escaped quotes
5. **References:** KQ1-3 for standard verbs, SQ1 for tone/style and recurring terms
